    <h2 class="subtitle">The <span>Melt</span> Story</h2>
    <p>
      Melt was born on a cold autumn day of 2009. The sky was cloudy and 
      the first autumn leaves had fallen from the trees covering the frosty earth in a golden carpet.
      The Melt team was working on one of their consulting projects - business as usual - 
      but this day they suddenly had enough of hacking lousy web frameworks and thought "heck, why not do this on our own?"     
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time earlier, lead developer Hannes Landeholm had already begun working on the first building blocks.
      The team decided to initiate development of a project dubbed NanoMVC.
      NanoMVC was used internally for dozens of consulting projects and heavily iterated upon.
      In 2011 the framework was released to the public under a BSD License and since then the excitement has been shared with the world.
