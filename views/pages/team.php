    <h2 class="subtitle">The <span>Melt</span> Story</h2>
    <p>
      Melt was born on a cold autumn day of 2009. The sky was cloudy and 
      the first autumn leaves had fallen from the trees covering the frostbitten ground in a golden carpet.
      The Melt team was working on one of their consulting projects - business as usual - 
      but this day they suddenly had enough of hacking lousy web frameworks and thought "heck, why not do this on our own?".
      <b>And so, Melt was born.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The new framework had a mission: keep complexity to a minimum.
      Dozens and dozens of projects would be powered by Melt in the years to come.        
      In July 2011 the Melt framework was released to the public under a BSD License. Since then, the northern light has been shared with the world.
